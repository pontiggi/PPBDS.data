## Causal effect

<!-- Potential Outcomes, Estimands  -->
Retrys are not allowed on multiple choice questions, so read and answer carefully!

```{r question-causal-effect}
quiz(
question("What is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference?",
    answer("It is impossible to observe multiple potential outcomes at once.", correct = TRUE, message = "Nice!"),
    answer("We don't know the potential outcomes for people not surveyed.", message = "Go read the section on Causal Effects"), 
    allow_retry = FALSE
  ),
question_text(
    "Explain a 'counterfactual' in a brief phrase. 'Potential outcome' might be helpful to use in your answer.",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),
question_text(
  "In one sentence, explain what causal effect is according to the RCM?",
  allow_retry = F,
  answer(NULL, correct = T),
  incorrect = "Ok"
  ),

         answer("$Y$", correct = T),

         random_answer_order = T

  answer(NULL, correct = T),
  incorrect = "Ok",
  trim = F
  )
)
```

## Potential outcomes

```{r question-potential-outcomes}
quiz(
question_text("In two sentences, what makes a Preceptor Table ideal, and why is this generally impossible to observe? (You should use the phrase 'potential outcomes' in your answer)",
    allow_retry = F,

    incorrect = "Ok"

  "If we did not have an ideal Preceptor Table, could we directly calculate the causal effect for an individual like Yao?",
  answer("No", correct = T),
  answer("Yes"),
  allow_retry = F

)
```

## Estimands

```{r question-estimands}
quiz(
question_text("In one sentence, define what an estimand is, and give an example.",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,

  answer("most positive causal effect", correct = T),
  answer("+2", correct = F),
  allow_retry = F, 
  random_answer_order = T

```

Use the following ideal Preceptor Table to answer some questions about potential estimands we might be interested in.

```{r question-estimands2-setup, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("11", "13", "10", "8", "6"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "10", "11", "10", "4"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$"))  %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol))  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff))
```

```{r question-estimands2-quiz}
quiz(

    answer("+2", correct = T),
    allow_retry = T
  ),

    answer("1"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3", correct = TRUE),
    answer("4"),
    answer("5"),
    allow_retry = F
  ),
question("On whom did the treatment have the most negative causal effect?",
    answer("Tahmid", correct = T),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
question("What was the treatment effect percentage on Diego? (answer as +/-X%)",
    answer("+50%", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

```

## Preceptor Table structure

```{r question-preceptortable2}

    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),

  answer("Predictions", correct = F),
  answer("Observations", correct = F),
  allow_retry = F, 
  random_answer_order = T
),
question_text("What is the correct order of columns in a Preceptor Table following the ID column? (list in order from left to right starting with the ID column).",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

## Simple models

```{r question-simplemodels}
quiz(
question_text("In a very short sentence or phrase, why do we need a models?",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

## A single value for tau

```{r question-singletau}
quiz(
question_text("In one sentence, what is the big assumption we are making about casual effect by only using one value for tau?",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

Use the following actual Preceptor Table to answer questions about a single value for tau.

```{r question-singletau-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare-actual, echo=FALSE}
actualPT <- tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c(13, 11, NA, NA, 5),
       ycontrol = c(NA, NA, 10, 12, NA),
       ydiff = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```

<!-- CB: Don't know if this is actually useful at all but maybe people would like it to practice -->

```{r question-single-tau-console, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-actual"}

# A tibble with the values used in the above Preceptor Table is loaded as
# actualPT. You can use this console for your convenience, but nothing you do in
# the console will be graded.

glimpse(actualPT)
```

```{r question-singletau2}

    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  ),
  question_text("Describe in one sentence/equation how you would estimate a single value for tau.",
    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
  )
)
```

The same Preceptor Table and console to minimize scrolling.

```{r question-singletau3-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

  )
)
```

## Two values for tau

As we do in the book, let's now assume that we think causal effect varies across sexes. We will use two estimates for tau. (Cassidy and Emma are female, Tahmid, Diego and Yao are males).

```{r question-twotau-setup, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$ID$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Outcomes$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$Estimands$$", vars(ydiff)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare-two-tau, echo=FALSE}
actualPT <- tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c(13, 11, NA, NA, 5),
       ycontrol = c(NA, NA, 10, 12, NA),
       ydiff = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
```

```{r question-two-tau-console, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-two-tau"}

    allow_retry = F,
    answer(NULL, correct = T),
    trim = F,
    incorrect = "Ok"
