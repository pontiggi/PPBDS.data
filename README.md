University.

## Using the data

Once the library is loaded and you have confirmed that it can be
accessed in your local environment, the data sets can be called as
objects and used like any other data you would otherwise read in and
assign to an object manually. See the following example of a plot using
`PPBDS.data::qscores`.

``` r

library(ggplot2)

qscores %>%
  filter(department == "GOV") %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = workload, x = enrollment)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = term)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Rudimentary Graphic to Test Function",
    subtitle = "Better graphic, potentially from 1005 work coming",
    caption = "Never forget to cite")
```

<!-- DK: We need some comments explaining what this is doing and how we can replace it. Specifically, why place the figure in man/ rather than inst/? -->
